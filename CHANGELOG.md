### CDC Guideline Alignment

Fully implements CDC Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule 2025.1 (Updated July 2, 2025):

- DTaP/Tdap: Dose 5 exception, adolescent booster logic
- MenACWY: Single dose at 16+, college catch-up through age 21
- Pneumococcal: PCV20-aware catch-up recommendations
- HPV: 3-dose schedule for immunocompromised
- COVID-19: Routine recommendations by age
- Rotavirus: Age-out enforcement (max 8 months)
- All vaccines: Minimum age, intervals, contraindications

### Testing

- 8/8 CDC QA scenarios passing
- 60%+ code coverage on vaccine logic
- Automated testing in CI
- QA script validates CDC compliance locally

### Known Limitations

- OpenAI API required for text parsing (cost: ~$0.01-0.03 per parse)
- No offline mode (requires API connectivity)
- No persistent session history
- English language only
