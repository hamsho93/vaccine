### Detailed Recommendations to Improve the Codebase

To enhance the provided codebases for better alignment with the CDC's 2025 Recommended Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule, I recommend a series of targeted improvements. These focus on accuracy, flexibility, and completeness, addressing the misalignments identified in the previous assessment. The suggestions are categorized by theme, with specific code changes, rationale based on CDC guidelines, and example implementations (in pseudocode or direct modifications). All references to CDC rules are drawn from the 2025 schedule notes and catch-up tables.

Prioritize testing any changes using the `code_execution` tool (though not invoked here, as this is a final response). Ensure updates maintain the codebase's modular structure while incorporating dynamic elements like vaccine products and age-dependent logic.

#### 1. **Add Product-Specific Logic for Vaccines with Brand Variations**
   - **Rationale**: Vaccines like Rotavirus, COVID-19, and Meningococcal B have schedules that vary by product (e.g., Rotarix: 2 doses; RotaTeq: 3 doses). The current code uses simplified, non-product-aware rules, leading to inaccuracies. CDC emphasizes defaulting to the most conservative schedule (e.g., 3 doses for Rotavirus if unknown) but allows product-specific optimization.
   - **Affected Vaccines**: Rotavirus, COVID-19, Meningococcal B (partial), Hib/PCV (minor, as code approximates but could specify ActHIB vs. PedvaxHIB).
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - Extend the `CDCVaccineRules` interface to include a `productVariants` array or object, mapping products to custom doses/intervals.
     - In `getVaccineRecommendation`, add a parameter for `product` (e.g., from patient history) and adjust logic accordingly.
     - Example Modification in `cdcVaccineRules`:
       ```
       'rotavirus': {
         ... // existing
         dosesRequired: undefined, // Remove age-based function
         productVariants: {
           'Rotarix': { doses: 2, minimumIntervals: [28] }, // 4 weeks
           'RotaTeq': { doses: 3, minimumIntervals: [28, 28] }, // 4 weeks each
           'Unknown': { doses: 3, minimumIntervals: [28, 28] } // Default per CDC
         },
         notes: ['If product unknown or mixed, complete 3-dose series.']
       },
       ```
     - Logic Update in `VaccineCatchUpService` (for Rotavirus case):
       ```
       case 'rotavirus':
         const product = request.vaccineHistory.product || 'Unknown'; // Assume added to input
         const variant = cdcRules.productVariants[product];
         const requiredDoses = variant.doses;
         // ... Use requiredDoses in numDoses checks
         if (numDoses >= requiredDoses) { seriesComplete = true; }
         // Adjust nextDoseDate using variant.minimumIntervals
       ```
     - Similar for COVID-19: Add variants for 'Pfizer' (3 doses for 6m–4y, intervals [21,56] days min) vs. 'Moderna' (2 doses, [28] days).
     - For MenB: Update to reflect 2025 alignment—2 doses at 6 months for routine (both Bexsero/Trumenba), but allow 1-month min for Bexsero in high-risk; add 3-dose for high-risk (0,1–2m,6m).

#### 2. **Correct and Dynamically Adjust Intervals Based on Age and Context**
   - **Rationale**: Intervals must be age-dependent for some vaccines (e.g., Varicella: 3 months for <13y, 4 weeks for ≥13y). Current code uses fixed values, causing errors in catch-up recommendations. CDC specifies these in catch-up tables to minimize unnecessary doses while ensuring efficacy.
   - **Affected Vaccines**: Varicella, HPV (partial, as code approximates but could refine min 5m overall for 2-dose).
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - In `CDCVaccineRules`, make `minimumIntervals` a function: `(ageYears: number, doseNum: number) => number[]`.
     - Example for Varicella:
       ```
       'varicella': {
         ... // existing
         minimumIntervals: (ageYears) => ageYears < 13 ? [90] : [28], // Days: 3m or 4w
         notes: ['Interval: 3 months if <13 years; 4 weeks if ≥13 years.']
       },
       ```
     - Logic Update in `getVaccineRecommendation` (Varicella case):
       ```
       case 'varicella':
         const intervalDays = cdcRules.minimumIntervals(currentAgeYears)[0];
         if (numDoses === 1) {
           const nextDate = this.addDays(sortedDoses[0].date, intervalDays);
           // ... Use nextDate for recommendation
         }
       ```
     - Validate prior doses: If a dose was given too early (beyond grace period), mark as invalid and recommend repeat (using existing `isDoseTooEarly`).

#### 3. **Enhance Catch-Up and Special Situation Handling**
   - **Rationale**: Catch-up logic is basic; CDC provides granular tables (e.g., Hib: detailed based on age at first dose and product). Special situations (e.g., immunocompromised requiring extra doses) are listed but not fully integrated into dose calculations. Add checks for evidence of immunity (e.g., lab confirmation for Varicella/HepB).
   - **Affected Vaccines**: Hib, PCV, COVID-19, HPV, MenB.
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - Add a `catchUpRules` field to `CDCVaccineRules`: object with age ranges mapping to required doses/intervals.
     - Example for Hib:
       ```
       'haemophilus_influenzae_type_b': {
         ... // existing
         catchUpRules: {
           '<12m': { doses: 3, intervals: [28,28,56] }, // Plus booster
           '12-59m': { doses: 1 if unvaccinated, else complete series },
           // Use functions for complex logic
         }
       },
       ```
     - In logic: Query patient history for immunity evidence (add input field); if present, set `seriesComplete = true`.
     - For special conditions: Dynamically increase `dosesRequired` (e.g., HPV: always 3 for immunocompromised).
       ```
       if (specialConditions.immunocompromised && normalizedName === 'hpv') {
         requiredDoses = 3;
       }
       ```

#### 4. **Improve Annual/Seasonal Vaccine Logic (e.g., Influenza, COVID-19)**
   - **Rationale**: These require checking prior seasons/doses. Code treats as fixed but notes 2 doses for Influenza first-timers <9y; doesn't verify history.
   - **Detailed Changes**:
     - Add `isAnnual: true` to rules; in logic, check last dose date vs. current season (July 1–June 30).
     - For Influenza: If age <9y and <2 prior lifetime doses, recommend 2 doses (4w apart).
       ```
       case 'influenza':
         if (currentAgeYears < 9 && totalLifetimeDoses < 2) { // Assume tracked in history
           recommendation = 'Give 2 doses, 4 weeks apart (first season)';
         } else {
           recommendation = 'Give annual dose now';
         }
       ```
     - For COVID-19: Integrate product-specific primaries and boosters (e.g., additional for immunocompromised every 2m).

#### 5. **General Enhancements for Robustness and Usability**
   - **Input Validation and Error Handling**: Add checks for invalid dates/products; throw descriptive errors.
   - **Documentation and Modularity**: Comment code with CDC references (e.g., // Per CDC 2025 Catch-Up Table 2). Extract common functions (e.g., `calculateNextDoseDate`).
   - **Performance/Extensibility**: Use enums for vaccine names/products; cache rules for faster lookups.
   - **Testing**: Suggest unit tests, e.g., for a 5-year-old with partial Varicella: expect interval 90 days.
   - **Versioning**: Add a `cdcVersion` check; if outdated, log warning (2025 rules effective from Jan 1, 2025).

Implementing these will make the codebase more compliant, reducing errors in recommendations. Total effort: ~20-30 hours for a developer, focusing on high-impact areas like product variants first.
