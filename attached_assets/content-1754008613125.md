# Catch-up Immunization Schedule for Children and Adolescents (Addendum updated July 2, 2025)

Recommendations for Ages 18 Years or Younger, United States, 2025

Health Care Providers

July 2, 2025

## Purpose

Guide health care providers in determining recommended catch-up schedule for children/adolescents whose vaccination is delayed.

## How to use the schedule

[Vaccines and Other Immunizing Agents in the Child and Adolescent Immunization Schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-schedule-vaccines.html)

To make vaccination recommendations, healthcare providers should:

1. Determine recommended vaccine by age ( [**Table 1 – By Age**](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html))
2. Determine recommended interval for catch-up vaccination ( [**Table 2 - Catch-up**](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-catch-up.html#table-2))
3. Assess need for additional recommended vaccines by medical condition or other indication ( [**Table 3 – By Medical Indication**](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-medical-indication.html))
4. Review vaccine types, frequencies, intervals, and considerations for special situations ( **[Notes](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-notes.html)**)
5. Review contraindications and precautions for vaccine types ( **[Appendix](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-appendix.html)**)
6. Review new or updated ACIP guidance ( [**Addendum**](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-addendum.html))
