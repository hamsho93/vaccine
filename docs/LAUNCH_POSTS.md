**Title:** Show HN: VaxRecord – Open source vaccine history parser with CDC recommendations

**Post:**

I built VaxRecord to help healthcare providers quickly parse unstructured vaccine records and generate CDC-compliant catch-up recommendations.

**What it does:**
- Paste messy vaccine history text (from medical records, printouts, etc.)
- AI parses it into structured data
- Generates CDC 2025-compliant catch-up recommendations
- Shows what vaccines are needed, when, and why

**Why I built it:**
Pediatricians spend hours manually cross-referencing vaccine histories with CDC catch-up schedules. This tool automates that process.

**Tech stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
- AWS Amplify Gen 2 (Lambda + API Gateway)
- OpenAI GPT-4o for parsing
- Comprehensive test suite with CDC QA validation

**Try it:**
- Live demo: [your-amplify-url]
- GitHub: https://github.com/hamsho93/vaccine
- Quick start: `npm ci && npm run dev`

**Open source:**
- MIT license
- Contributions welcome
- 21 vaccines supported
- 8 automated CDC compliance tests

Looking for feedback from healthcare professionals and devs interested in public health tech!

- Handles messy formats (various date formats, abbreviations, age notations)
- Age-specific recommendations
- Minimum interval validation
- Export to JSON/CSV

**Tech:**
- Serverless (AWS Amplify)
- Privacy-first (no data storage)
- Open source (MIT license)
- Comprehensive testing

**For healthcare orgs:**
- Self-host on your AWS account (~$15-70/month)
- HIPAA-compliant deployment guide included
- No vendor lock-in

**For developers:**
- TypeScript + React
- Well-documented architecture

**Title:** [Tool] Open source vaccine history parser for catch-up scheduling

**Post:**

Hi r/medicine,

I've created an open source tool that might help with vaccine catch-up scheduling. Thought I'd share in case it's useful for your practice.

**What it does:**
1. Paste unstructured vaccine history (from any source)
2. AI parses it into structured doses
3. Generates CDC 2025-compliant catch-up recommendations

**Use case:**
Patients transferring from another provider, incomplete records, refugees/immigrants, or anyone needing catch-up evaluation.

**CDC compliance:**
- Based on Child & Adolescent Immunization Schedule 2025.1
- 8 automated tests validate CDC rules
- Clear documentation of guideline alignment
- Links to specific CDC notes for each vaccine

**Privacy:**
- No patient data stored
- Session-only processing
- HIPAA-compliant when self-deployed

**Open source:**
- MIT license (free for any use)
- Deploy your own instance
- Contribute improvements

Repo: https://github.com/hamsho93/vaccine

Not trying to replace clinical judgment - just a tool to speed up the mechanical parts of catch-up scheduling.

Feedback welcome, especially from pediatricians and family medicine docs!

## Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1:**
🚀 Excited to open source VaxRecord - a vaccine history parser with CDC-compliant catch-up recommendations!

Built for clinicians who spend too much time manually cross-referencing vaccine schedules.

🔗 https://github.com/hamsho93/vaccine

🧵 Thread on why this matters ⬇️

**Tweet 2:**
Problem: Patient shows up with messy vaccine records. You need to figure out what they need.

Current process:
- Decipher handwritten notes
- Look up each vaccine in CDC schedule
- Calculate intervals
- Determine catch-up doses

⏰ Takes 15-30 minutes per patient

**Tweet 3:**
VaxRecord automates this:

1️⃣ Paste vaccine history text
2️⃣ AI structures the data
3️⃣ Get CDC recommendations instantly

Supports 21 vaccines, handles various formats, calculates intervals, flags early doses.

⚡ Results in seconds

**Tweet 4:**
Why open source?

✅ Public health impact > proprietary advantage
✅ Community can improve accuracy
✅ Free for clinics without budget
✅ Transparent CDC alignment
✅ Enable global adoption

MIT license - use it anywhere, modify as needed

**Tweet 5:**
Tech details for the devs:

- React + TypeScript + Vite
- AWS Amplify Gen 2 (serverless)
- OpenAI GPT-4o for parsing
- Comprehensive test suite
- ~$15-70/month to self-host

Great project for learning healthcare tech or contributing to public health! 💙
